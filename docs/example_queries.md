## Usage Examples

### Running the Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Run full scraping and analysis pipeline
python main.py --mode full --verbose

# Scrape specific categories
python main.py --mode scrape --categories "https://www.aliexpress.com/category/100003070/electronics.html"

# Scrape search terms
python main.py --mode scrape --search "wireless headphones" "phone case" --pages 3

# Generate insights only
python main.py --mode insights

# Analyze existing data
python main.py --mode analyze
```

### Using Airflow DAGs
```bash
# Start Airflow webserver
airflow webserver --port 8080

# Start Airflow scheduler
airflow scheduler

# Trigger a DAG manually
airflow dags trigger aliexpress_daily_scraping

# Check DAG status
airflow dags list
```

### Database Operations
```python
from aliai.database import ClickHouseClient

# Connect to database
db = ClickHouseClient()

# Get product statistics
stats = await db.get_product_stats()
print(f"Total products: {stats['total_products']}")

# Get trending products
trending = await db.get_trending_products(days=7, limit=20)
for product in trending:
    print(f"{product['title']} - Score: {product['trend_score']}")

# Close connection
db.close()
```

This comprehensive set of queries and examples provides everything needed to analyze AliExpress data for business intelligence, trend detection, and dropshipping opportunities.
